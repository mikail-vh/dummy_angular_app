 * APP COMPONENT
 *
 * Purpose: Root component that bootstraps the entire application
 *
 * Key Concepts Demonstrated:
 * 1. **Root Component**: Entry point for the Angular application
 * 2. **Component Composition**: Including child components (navbar)
 * 3. **Routing**: Using router-outlet for navigation
 * 4. **Service Integration**: Initializing theme service
 * 5. **Standalone Components**: Modern Angular architecture

   * injecting it here ensures it's created early and can initialize the theme
   * from localStorage or system preferences.

/**
 * COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
 *
 * 1. **Standalone Components** (Angular 14+):
 *    - No need for NgModule declarations
 *    - Self-contained with their own imports
 *    - Easier to understand and maintain
 *
 * 2. **Service Injection**:
 *    - Services are injected in the constructor
 *    - Injecting a service ensures it's instantiated
 *    - Services are singletons by default
 *
 * 3. **Component Lifecycle**:
 *    - constructor() - Dependency injection
 *    - ngOnInit() - Component initialization
 *    - ngOnDestroy() - Cleanup (if needed)
 *
 * 4. **Template Communication**:
 *    - Properties are accessible in templates
 *    - Methods can be called from templates
 *    - Events can be handled with (event)="method()"
 *
 * 5. **Child Components**:
 *    - Include child components in imports array
 *    - Use their selectors in the template
 *    - Pass data via @Input() properties
 *    - Listen to events via @Output() properties
 *
 * BEST PRACTICES:
 *
 * 1. Keep components focused on presentation
 * 2. Delegate business logic to services
 * 3. Use OnPush change detection when possible
 * 4. Implement OnDestroy for cleanup
 * 5. Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
 * 6. Follow Angular style guide conventions
