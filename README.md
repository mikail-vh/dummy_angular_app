## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Angular 19** - Modern web framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **SCSS** - Enhanced CSS with variables and mixins
- **RxJS** - Reactive programming library
- **CSS Custom Properties** - Dynamic theming
- **Modern CSS** - Flexbox, Grid, and responsive design

## 📚 Learning Concepts Covered

### 1. **Component Architecture**
- Component lifecycle (ngOnInit, ngOnDestroy)
- Input/Output properties for component communication
- Standalone components vs traditional modules
- Template binding techniques (interpolation, property binding, event binding)

### 2. **Services and Dependency Injection**
- Creating and using services
- Singleton pattern with `providedIn: 'root'`
- Service communication between components
- Observable patterns for reactive programming

### 3. **Routing and Navigation**
- Route configuration and lazy loading
- Navigation guards and resolvers
- Route parameters and query strings
- Router outlet and navigation strategies

### 4. **State Management**
- Service-based state management
- BehaviorSubject for state streams
- Subscription management and memory leaks prevention
- Reactive forms and data flow

### 5. **Styling and Theming**
- SCSS variables and mixins
- CSS custom properties for runtime theming
- Responsive design with media queries
- CSS architecture and organization

### 6. **Accessibility**
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast and reduced motion support

## 🎨 Theme System

The application features a comprehensive theming system:

### Light Theme (Default)
- Clean, bright interface
- High contrast for readability
- Professional color palette

### Dark Theme
- Easy on the eyes for low-light environments
- Automatic system preference detection
- Smooth transitions between themes

### Theme Implementation
```typescript
// Theme service manages global theme state
themeService.toggleTheme();           // Switch themes
themeService.isDarkMode$;            // Observable for theme state
themeService.getCurrentTheme();      // Get current theme
```

## 🧭 Navigation Structure

### Home Page (`/home`)
- Welcome message with time-based greeting
- Feature showcase with interactive cards
- Learning resources and external links
- Theme toggle demonstration

### Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)
- Sample analytics and metrics
- Interactive data visualization
- Statistics cards with animations
- Responsive chart components

### Profile Page (`/profile`)
- User profile information
- Settings and preferences
- Statistics and achievements
- Form examples and validation

## 💡 Code Examples and Learning

### Component Communication
```typescript
// Parent to Child (Input)
@Input() data: any;

// Child to Parent (Output)
@Output() dataChange = new EventEmitter<any>();

// Service Communication
constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}
```

### Reactive Programming
```typescript
// Observable subscription with cleanup
ngOnInit() {
  this.dataService.data$
    .pipe(takeUntil(this.destroy$))
    .subscribe(data => this.handleData(data));
}

ngOnDestroy() {
  this.destroy$.next();
  this.destroy$.complete();
}
```

### Template Techniques
```html
<!-- Property Binding -->
<div [class.active]="isActive" [style.color]="textColor">

<!-- Event Binding -->
<button (click)="handleClick($event)">

<!-- Two-way Binding -->
<input [(ngModel)]="userInput">

<!-- Structural Directives -->
<div *ngFor="let item of items; trackBy: trackByFn">
<div *ngIf="showContent">

<!-- Async Pipe -->
<div>{{ asyncData$ | async }}</div>
```
